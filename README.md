# Game-Tracker-Project

This is an application built using Java, MySQL, and Connector/J to keep track of what games I (or, in this case, you)
own and have beaten.

NOTE: YOU MUST HAVE AN INSTANCE OF A MYSQL SERVER RUNNING FOR THIS APPLICATION TO WORK.
  If you do not know how to do this, look up a program called XAMPP.

This application will be updating daily, if not every other day, and can currently be run in Eclipse or any Java IDE.

You just import the project, and run it to see the program in action.
