# Game-Tracker-Project

This is an application built using Java, MySQL, and Connector/J to keep track of what games I own and have beaten.

This project was used as a testing ground, for me to learn Java more and how it works with MySQL. It does NOT work on other people's machines, only on mine through LocalHost.

This code is depreciated, and is not going to be updated any more.

I am proud of the "final" product, even if there are some tiny bugs with the program itself.

I am moving on to revamp this project in C# and .NET to make it more of a Web Application.
